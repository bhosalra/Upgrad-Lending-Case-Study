Case objective:\n","#This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures.\n","#Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.\n","#The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.\n","#The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.\n","\n","# Contents\n","# this notebook covers the project for the lending case study.\n","# The dataset used contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not.\n","# The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for
