## General Information
This repo holds the lending case study for module 1 of ML
Solving this assignment will give you an idea about how real business problems are solved using EDA

Business Understanding:
You work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile.

The data given below contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

In this case study, you will use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.

## Conclusions
If Verification status = ‘ Not Verified’ or ‘Source Verified’, it contributes to almost 67% of total charge-off applications.
Applications in CA, NY and FL have higher chance of charge-off as compared to other states.
Open Accounts of the customer have a direct impact on the charge off ratio
Debt consolidation is the top contributor of the loan charge-off
25% of the total charged-off applicants had 10+ years of employment experience. 
Majority of the loans were between 5000-15000.
